<p>The best way to contact me is by <a href="mailto:vanessapw@protonmail.com">email</a>.</p>

<p>All my social media can be found on my <a href="https://linktr.ee/vanessapPT">linktree</a>.</p>

<h3 id="buy-me-a-coffee">Buy me a coffee</h3>
<p>I found the ideology of this website pretty interesting. Although it can be used in many ways, in my case, if you donate I will <em>stricly</em> use it to try new coffees while I am working or having some chill time - coffee is my fuel, so I will be very happy if someone donates or even send me some great coffee to try!

<p><em>yay</em></p>
