<h4>About</h4>
			
<p>I am from Porto, Portugal - the best place in the world (:</p>
<p> About my qualifications - I have a degree in Medical Computing and Instrumentation Engineering, one subfield of Biomedical Engineering, which gave me combined skills in engineering and health sciences. I had also the opportunity to study abroad as an erasmus student for a year in Poland and that experience offered me the chance to expand my soft skills in communication with different cultures and also allowed me to meet new horizons. As we say, the sky is the limit! I enjoyed so much the previous experience, that I decided to do it again, but this time in Slovenia, where I am currently living.</p>
<p>I consider myself a hard working person and I never give up. I love to learn and I consider myself an autodidact. Some of my current challenges are learning how to program with web frameworks such angular or javascript and how to play the piano only by hearing some songs. Oh and my hobbies: I love to travel and I do not mind to live abroad some few years more. Plus, I really like to play some online games such as league of legends, nfs, skyrim and PUBG - and I love to sleep.</p>
