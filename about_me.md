## About me

_Hey there!_
As you have already noticed, I am Vanessa, nice to e-meet you!

I am from the lovely city of Porto in Portugal.

I have the quite average hobbies: 
* I like to travel a lot - I really love to learn about new cultures, try new food, listen and learn about local history. I have lived in some countries in Europe which made me even more curious to learn more. Latelly I have started to appreciate japanese culture a lot (not the working tho :D). 
* Listen to music and go to live concerts - LOVE IT. Everywhere I go, you will see me with headphones on listenning to something. I have a [last.fm page]( https://www.last.fm/user/vanessaandreia) if you wanna check up the styles I like (they vary a lot!), if you have any suggestion on great music, please give me an hint! But in summary I like bands like Muse, Daft Punk, Florence and the Machine, Depeche Mode, Roxette...
* I also like to play games, a lot I must say - pc games, console games, board games... anything that has the word _game_. Sometimes I do streaming (mostly fortnite - yes, you can joke but I actually find it really fun to play! - I have a [Twitch channel](https://www.twitch.tv/razorlight17) where you can catch me playing sometimes and I invite you to join me if you want. I am not a pro, I play for fun and relax after work with some friends.
* For more, just contact me :D

No, I am not speaking about work in this section, that's not what defines me or who I am, check the other pages ðŸ˜œ
