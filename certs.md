## Docs and some usefull information about HIT
Since I believe that information should be available for free to everyone, here are some presentations I have been doing over the last years in the health informatics area. They are mostly on openEHR. Note that some info might be outdated.
* [openEHR.NL Conference 17/11/23 - openEHR in Luxembourg research â€“ The Clinnova Initiative](https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/vanessa-pereira.github.io/blob/master/docs/LIH_openehr_conf_20231117_vp.pdf)
* [openEHR full workflow 2019](https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/vanessa-pereira.github.io/blob/master/docs/vanessapereira_openehr_full_march2019.pdf) - I was employed by Better when I did this presentation that's why it has the logos and "looks", I don't have the original file for edition, only pdf, but hope it help others to learn the process.
* [openEHR quick basics 052022](https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/vanessa-pereira.github.io/blob/master/docs/openehr_basics_20220516.pdf)
* [openEHR quick basics 062022](https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/vanessa-pereira.github.io/blob/master/docs/openehr_basics_20220608.pdf)
* [openEHR implementation processes quick thought-ups 2018](https://github.com/vanessa-pereira/vanessa-pereira.github.io/blob/master/docs/openehr_basics_and_workflow_2018_quick_vanessap.pdf)

I am also starting some tutorials on openEHR modelling, building archetypes and recording them so its possible to see what in fact needs to be done. I have done an [Youtube channel with an openEHR playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdIPeFiGMx2gNCRDHB1fwjRU8ZMXsiblg), I will try to post a 1-2 videos per month about modelling and implementation. It will be open to other standards too. If you subscribe I would also appreciate that.
