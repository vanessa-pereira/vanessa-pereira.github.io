				<p>Hey there.</p> 
				<p>If you are reading this, you probably want to know what I am doing.</p> 
				<p>Currently I am working as a functional analyst in a healthcare IT company, where I am also writing my dissertation / thesis as a MSc Medical Informatics student.</p> 
				<p>As a part of the dissertation, a script is being developed for versioning management of openEHR archetypes in local repositories and verification of compliance from those archetypes with the openEHR CKM, in order to have all resources updated. When this script is finished, I will publicly share it under my github account.</p>
				<p>This page will be mostly use to post information about some code that I will be doing and respective info and steps. I hope it can be somehow usefull. </p> 
			<p><a href="/about">Click here if you want to read more about me.</a> You can also send me an email or check my github page - check the links bellow.</p>
