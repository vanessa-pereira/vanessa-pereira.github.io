### Overall stuff recommendations
You might be asking why did put this section here. Over the years I have been finding pretty good deals in the internet that might also be interested for others. Some friends have also mentioned that some of the things I have found or used are great for a daily use and that I should put them somewhere for other people know about it too. So here it is! You can find some of these in the following links. This section can be pretty random, can go from tech stuff to homie stuff or even skin care :)

#### Home stuff
These are some stuff i have discovered recently and made my work and relax time more confortable. I hope you can enjoy them too.
* Feet warmer usb: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3GLAryO) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3OGxmC0) (this is so good for winter, every year I buy one. If you WFM, just put it on your shoes or slippers and it mantains your foot warm all day)
* Massage cushion with heat: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3gFWDzD) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3F6RWs9) (helps a lot with backpain)

#### Coffee
Who survives without coffee...
* Best nespresso capsules in my opinion: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3OOt4bN) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3XF3nye)
* Super cheap nespreso capsule: I was impress by the soft cherry alike taste [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3F9ho0g) or chocolate [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3F7GQDf) - for lattes, 10 cent a pod it's a pretty good deal.
* The best coffee you will ever have: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3GPqxfo) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3VccIw9) (Portuguese brand) 
* Coffee machine: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3u3Bl1V) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3EJ3ksJ)
* Coffee grinder: [Amazon.es](https://amzn.to/3AKIXdB) or [Amazon.de](https://amzn.to/3GQitLq)

#### Skin and overall body care
I had a realy bad period with severe acne where I had to take some medicine for a long period of time. The junction of these products below helped removing all the scars and I still use them every day. They are way cheaper on amazon comparing with pharmacies.
