## My setup and recommedations
You might be asking why did I put this section here. Over the years I have been finding pretty good deals over the internet that might also be interesting for others - I really like these products and I am usually quite picky with what is a good quality product vs a reasonable price.
_(Note: I have affiliation with Amazon, so it would be pretty cool for me if you could use some of these links, I can get a few bucks at no cost for you :D )_

### Overall stuff recommendations
You might be asking why did put this section here. Over the years I have been finding pretty good deals in the internet that might also be interested for others.
