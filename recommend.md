## My setup and recommedations
You might be asking why did I put this section here. Over the years I have been finding pretty good deals over the internet that might also be interesting for others - I really like these products and I am usually quite picky with what is a good quality product vs a reasonable price.
_(Note: I have affiliation with Amazon, so it would be pretty cool for me if you could use some of these links, I can get a few bucks at no cost for you :D )_

### Overall stuff recommendations
You might be asking why did put this section here. Over the years I have been finding pretty good deals in the internet that might also be interested for others. Some friends have also mentioned that some of the things I have found or used are great for a daily use and that I should put them somewhere for other people know about it too. So here it is! You can find some of these in the following links. This section can be pretty random, can go from tech stuff to homie stuff or even skin care :)
